# Negative Control To Test Cytophatic Effect on Virus Identification Protocol

## Description

## Protocol



Monitor Vero cells for CPE.

observe for 5 to 10 days!


### Composition Overview

* 500 microleters of Universal Transport Medium
* Vero (Cercopithecus aethiops, kidney epithelial) cells
** primary rehesus monkey kidney cells (RhMK)
* Air–liquid interface ?
* Incubation at 37°C with 5% carbon dioxide. 
* Could also be 35°C but still 5% CO2

### Observation

* Monitored daily with light microscopy for cytopathic effects.
* Inverted Microscop?

## Possible Laboratories

* Pathlab.co.nz

## Feasability of Home Trial

Since we are NOT working with infectious substances, it maybe possible to try this expirement at home first before spending on a laboratory. This will also allow the authors to gain first hand knowledge over the process so that when we do go to a lab, we will better be able to communicate our requirements.

### Components needed
* Small Incubator that can manage temperature at least between 35°C to 37°C
* Already have 1600x microscope
* Need to consider percuring an inverted microscope (so that we can look at the sample from under neath the tissue).
* Order RhMK
* Order UTM
* Antibiotics (need to reference the scientific papers that recommend specifics)
* Solutions (not sure what is needed her but possible a medium that is used to suspend the RhMK).

## Cost

* Incubator ?
* Inverted Microscope ?
* RhMK - $1.5 USD / tube to $6.50USD / tube
* UTM ?
* Antibiotics ?
* Solutions ?
* Test Tubes ?
* Measuring tubes ?
