# negative-control-detection-protocol

Document and Paper to demonstrate the CPE on the "detection" protocol

## Initial Brainstorming

* Describe the process used to isolate human pathogenic virus.
* Setup an expirment that uses this same process excluding adding a sample.  Instead just use Monkey Kidney Cells + UTM + any additional antibiotics that are usually added.  Also ensure to keep the same ratio of nutriants as in the standard protocol.
* Observe
* Hypothesis - the virus isolation protocol causes CPE.
